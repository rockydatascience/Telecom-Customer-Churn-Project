Project Title :Customer Churn Analytics:
Abstract
In the competitive landscape of telecommunications, customer churn poses a significant challenge, impacting revenue and market share. This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns within a telecom company to understand the underlying factors contributing to customer attrition. The study leverages historical customer data, including demographic information, service usage metrics, and customer interaction logs. Through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, key drivers of churn will be identified, such as service dissatisfaction, pricing strategies, contract terms, and customer support effectiveness.
